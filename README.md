# Instagram-clone
A gateway project to learn best and up to date practices for web application by cloning the core features of Instagram, such as JavaScript, React, and Firebase. 
Additionally, one thing that I noticed that the Instagram Website lacked, if it was not mobile, is the ability to upload a post, as such I have included an upload post functionality as well as the core features of Instagram such as user, follow-following relationship, seeing a user's profile and posts, being able to comment and like a post, as well as user specific notifications, and changing a user avatar.
